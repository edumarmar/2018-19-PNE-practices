client-server model- to communicate between them

1.-the cleint starts the communication ( a request)
2.-the server generates a respond with the data that the client asks for

-there can be many clients
-the server is always running (it does not require to have clients)
-the server can also be in the same computer as the client
-they communicate through the internet
-to identify a specific machine/server we use an IP address
-This address can change if you move or change networks
-One computer can have more than 1 IP address (network intefaces)

IP address looks like: 10.3.52.118(teacher mobile) or 10.3.52.237 (mobile)
212.128.253.82(computer), 212.128.253.64(teacher computer)
